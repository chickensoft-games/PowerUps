A collection of power-ups for your C# Godot game scripts that work with the [SuperNodes] source generator.

Currently, two PowerUps are provided by this package: `AutoNode` and `AutoDispose`.

- üå≤ AutoNode: automatically connect fields and properties to their corresponding nodes in the scene tree ‚Äî also provides access to nodes via their interfaces using [GodotNodeInterfaces].
- üöÆ AutoDispose: automatically dispose of disposable properties owned by your script when it exits the scene tree.

> Chickensoft also maintains a third PowerUp for dependency injection called `AutoInject` that resides in its own [AutoInject] repository.

## üì¶ Installation

Unlike most nuget packages, PowerUps are provided as source-only nuget packages that actually inject the source code for the PowerUp into your project.

> Injecting the code directly into the project referencing the PowerUp allows the [SuperNodes] source generator to see the code and generate the glue needed to make everything work without reflection.

To use the PowerUps, add the following to your `.csproj` file. Be sure to get the latest versions for each package on [Nuget]. Note that the `AutoNode` PowerUp requires the [GodotNodeInterfaces] package so that you can access Godot nodes by interface, rather than the concrete type, which facilitates unit testing.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.SuperNodes" Version="1.6.1" PrivateAssets="all" OutputItemType="analyzer" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.SuperNodes.Types" Version="1.6.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.PowerUps" Version="1.1.0" PrivateAssets="all" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces" Version="1.7.0-godot4.2.0-beta.1" />
    <!-- ^ Or whatever the latest versions are. -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## üå≤ AutoNode

The `AutoNode` PowerUp automatically connects fields and properties in your script to a declared node path or unique node name in the scene tree whenever the scene is instantiated, without reflection. It can also be used to connect nodes as interfaces, instead of concrete node types.

Simply apply the `[Node]` attribute to any field or property in your script that you want to automatically connect to a node in your scene.

If you don't specify a node path in the `[Node]` attribute, the name of the field or property will be converted to a [unique node identifier][unique-nodes] name in PascalCase. For example, the field name below `_my_unique_node` is converted to the unique node path name `%MyUniqueNode` by converting the property name to PascalCase and prefixing the percent sign indicator. Likewise, the property name `MyUniqueNode` is converted to `%MyUniqueNode`, which isn't much of a conversion since the property name is already in PascalCase.

For best results, use PascalCase for your node names in the scene tree (which Godot tends to do by default, anyways).

In the example below, we're using [GodotNodeInterfaces] to reference nodes as their interfaces instead of their concrete Godot types. This allows us to write a unit test where we fake the nodes in the scene tree by substituting mock nodes, allowing us to test a single node script at a time without polluting our test coverage.

```csharp
using Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces;
using Chickensoft.PowerUps;
using Godot;
using SuperNodes.Types;

[SuperNode(typeof(AutoNode))]
public partial class MyNode : Node2D {
  public override partial void _Notification(int what);

  [Node("Path/To/SomeNode")]
  public INode2D SomeNode { get; set; } = default!;

  [Node] // Connects to "%MyUniqueNode" since no path was specified.
  public INode2D MyUniqueNode { get; set; } = default!;

  [Node("%OtherUniqueName")]
  public INode2D DifferentName { get; set; } = default!;

  [Node] // Connects to "%MyUniqueNode" since no path was specified.
  internal INode2D _my_unique_node = default!;
}
```

### ü§Ø Using Interfaces

If you're using [GodotNodeInterfaces], you can access and manipulate descendent nodes via their interface instead of their concrete Godot type. Each AutoNode receives a number of additional methods that match a Godot method, but with the added "Ex" suffix (short for Extended).

- `AddChildEx()`
- `FindChildEx()`
- `FindChildrenEx()`
- `GetChildEx()`
- `GetChildrenEx()`
- `GetChildOrNullEx()`
- `GetChildCountEx()`
- `GetChildrenEx()`
- `GetNodeEx()`
- `GetNodeOrNullEx()`
- `HasNodeEx()`
- `RemoveChildEx()`

### üß™ Testing

We can easily write a test for the example above by substituting mock nodes:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces;
using Chickensoft.GoDotTest;
using Chickensoft.PowerUps.Tests.Fixtures;
using Godot;
using GodotTestDriver;
using Moq;
using Shouldly;

public class MyNodeTest : TestClass {
  private Fixture _fixture = default!;
  private MyNode _scene = default!;

  private Mock<INode2D> _someNode = default!;
  private Mock<INode2D> _myUniqueNode = default!;
  private Mock<INode2D> _otherUniqueNode = default!;

  public MyNodeTest(Node testScene) : base(testScene) { }

  [Setup]
  public async Task Setup() {
    _fixture = new(TestScene.GetTree());

    _someNode = new();
    _myUniqueNode = new();
    _otherUniqueNode = new();

    _scene = new MyNode();
    _scene.FakeNodeTree(new() {
      ["Path/To/SomeNode"] = _someNode.Object,
      ["%MyUniqueNode"] = _myUniqueNode.Object,
      ["%OtherUniqueName"] = _otherUniqueNode.Object,
    });

    await _fixture.AddToRoot(_scene);
  }

  [Cleanup]
  public async Task Cleanup() => await _fixture.Cleanup();

  [Test]
  public void UsesFakeNodeTree() {
    // Making a new instance of a node without instantiating a scene doesn't
    // trigger NotificationSceneInstantiated, so if we want to make sure our
    // AutoNodes get hooked up and use the FakeNodeTree, we need to do it manually.
    _scene._Notification((int)Node.NotificationSceneInstantiated);

    _scene.SomeNode.ShouldBe(_someNode.Object);
    _scene.MyUniqueNode.ShouldBe(_myUniqueNode.Object);
    _scene.DifferentName.ShouldBe(_otherUniqueNode.Object);
    _scene._my_unique_node.ShouldBe(_myUniqueNode.Object);
  }
}
```

## üöÆ AutoDispose

The `AutoDispose` PowerUp will automatically dispose of writeable properties on your script that implement `IDisposable` but do not inherit `Godot.Node` when the node exits the scene tree, preventing the need for manually cleaning up disposable, non-node objects that your script owns.

AutoDispose was designed to work nicely with the dependency injection system from [AutoInject] and disposable objects, like the bindings from [LogicBlocks].

```csharp
using Chickensoft.AutoInject;
using Chickensoft.PowerUps;
using Godot;
using SuperNodes.Types;

// Note that Dependent is a PowerUp provided by AutoInject.

[SuperNode(typeof(Dependent), typeof(AutoDispose))]
public partial class MyNode : Node2D {
  public override partial void _Notification(int what);

  // Use AutoInject to lookup the nearest SomeDisposable object provided above
  // us in the scene tree.
  //
  // Since this is a read-only property, it will not have Dispose called on it
  // by AutoDispose when we exit the scene tree. This is desirable since this
  // script doesn't own this object ‚Äî it just needs to use it.
  [Dependency]
  public SomeDisposable DisposableDependency => DependOn<SomeDisposable>();

  // This object will automatically have Dispose called on it by AutoDispose 
  // when we exit the scene tree since it is a writeable property (which tells
  // AutoDispose this script owns it and should dispose of it).
  public MyDisposable MyDisposableObject { get; set; } = default!;

  // Even though Godot nodes are disposable, this won't be disposed since it
  // inherits from Godot.Node. Godot manages node references automatically.
  public Node2D OtherNode { get; set; } = default!;

  // ...
```
