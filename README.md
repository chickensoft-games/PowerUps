A collection of power-ups for your C# Godot game scripts that work with the [SuperNodes] source generator.

Currently, two PowerUps are provided by this package: `AutoNode` and `AutoDispose`.

- üå≤ AutoNode: automatically connect fields and properties to their corresponding nodes in the scene tree.
- üöÆ AutoDispose: automatically dispose of disposable properties owned by your script when it exits the scene tree.

> Chickensoft also maintains a third PowerUp for dependency injection called `AutoInject` that resides in its own [AutoInject] repository.

## üì¶ Installation

Unlike most nuget packages, PowerUps are provided as source-only nuget packages that actually inject the source code for the PowerUp into your project.

> Injecting the code directly into the project referencing the PowerUp allows the [SuperNodes] source generator to see the code and generate the glue needed to make everything work without reflection.

To use the PowerUps, add the following to your `.csproj` file. Be sure to get the latest versions for each package on [Nuget]. Note that the `AutoNode` PowerUp requires the [GodotNodeInterfaces] package so that you can access Godot nodes by interface, rather than the concrete type, which facilitates unit testing.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.SuperNodes" Version="1.6.0" PrivateAssets="all" OutputItemType="analyzer" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.SuperNodes.Types" Version="1.6.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.PowerUps" Version="1.1.0" PrivateAssets="all" />
    <PackageReference Include="Chickensoft.GodotNodeInterfaces" Version="1.1.0-godot4.2.0-beta.1" />
    <!-- ^ Or whatever the latest versions are. -->
</ItemGroup>
```

## üå≤ AutoNode

The `AutoNode` PowerUp automatically connects fields and properties in your script to a declared node path or unique node name in the scene tree whenever the scene is instantiated.

Simply apply the `[Node]` attribute to any field or property in your script that you want to automatically connect to a node in your scene.

If you don't specify a node path, the name of the field or property will be converted to a [unique node identifier][unique-nodes] name in PascalCase. For best results, consider using PascalCase for node names in the scene tree.

```csharp
using Chickensoft.PowerUps;
using Godot;
using SuperNodes.Types;

[SuperNode(typeof(AutoNode))]
public partial class MyNode : Node2D {
  public override partial void _Notification(int what);

  // Automatically connect this field to the provided node path
  [Node("Path/To/MyNode")]
  private Node2D _myNode = default!;

  // If you don't specify a node path, AutoNode converts the name of the 
  // field to a unique node path specifier in PascalCase: %MyUniqueNode
  [Node]
  private Node2D _myUniqueNode = default!;

  // Just specify the unique name if it differs in more than just casing from
  // the field/property name.
  [Node("%OtherUniqueName")]
  private Node2D _differentName = default!;
}
```

## üöÆ AutoDispose

The `AutoDispose` PowerUp will automatically dispose of writeable properties on your script that implement `IDisposable` but do not inherit `Godot.Node` when the node exits the scene tree, preventing the need for manually cleaning up disposable, non-node objects that your script owns.

AutoDispose was designed to work nicely with the dependency injection system from [AutoInject] and disposable objects, like the bindings from [LogicBlocks].

```csharp
using Chickensoft.AutoInject;
using Chickensoft.PowerUps;
using Godot;
using SuperNodes.Types;

// Note that Dependent is a PowerUp provided by AutoInject.

[SuperNode(typeof(Dependent), typeof(AutoDispose))]
public partial class MyNode : Node2D {
  public override partial void _Notification(int what);

  // Use AutoInject to lookup the nearest SomeDisposable object provided above
  // us in the scene tree.
  //
  // Since this is a read-only property, it will not have Dispose called on it
  // by AutoDispose when we exit the scene tree. This is desirable since this
  // script doesn't own this object ‚Äî it just needs to use it.
  [Dependency]
  public SomeDisposable DisposableDependency => DependOn<SomeDisposable>();

  // This object will automatically have Dispose called on it by AutoDispose 
  // when we exit the scene tree since it is a writeable property (which tells
  // AutoDispose this script owns it and should dispose of it).
  public MyDisposable MyDisposableObject { get; set; } = default!;

  // Even though Godot nodes are disposable, this won't be disposed since it
  // inherits from Godot.Node. Godot manages node references automatically.
  public Node2D OtherNode { get; set; } = default!;

  // ...
```
